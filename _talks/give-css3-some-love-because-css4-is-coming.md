Firefox or Safari? IE8 or Edge? Android or iOS? Stop worrying about the browser, stop worrying about the version and embrace CSS3 in all it’s glory!

We’ll be exploring the latest features available, why they aren’t so widely adopted and how you can confidently implement them in to any website or application. Utilising progressive enhancement or graceful degradation without compromising UX or the need for cumbersome JavaScript!

We’ll also delve in to the latest specs for CSS4 and how we could potentially put these in to practice when they’re ready.
