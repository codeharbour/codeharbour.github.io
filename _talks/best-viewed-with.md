Are we doomed to see history repeat itself? Is our fascination with new tools going to break the inherent robustness of the web we know? Or, can these new tools help us progressively enhance the web even further than we are able to now?

My aim is to take a look at the current state of the web and whether progressive enhancement is still plausible. Looking beyond whether a website works with JavaScript turned off or not. Instead looking at what new tools can offer and especially what game changing software is coming in the near future.
