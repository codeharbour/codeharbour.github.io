In this talk I'll demonstrate how it is possible to architect and write complex client side JavaScript applications in ECMAScript 6 today, despite a lack of implementations across browsers. We'll explore how we can use libraries like SystemJS and Babel to allow us to seamlessly write code in ES6 and consume 3rd party libraries, regardless of the format they are written in. We'll then architect the application as a series of modules using the new ES6 module syntax, and write using new ES6 features like constants, arrow functions, classes and more.

Using [jspm](http://jspm.io/) as our build tool, we'll see how to quickly and easily install libraries from npm and GitHub, and have them work out of the box in the browser. We'll look at the developer workflow and how jspm also makes it trivial to bundle our application up in production.
