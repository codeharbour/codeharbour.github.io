This is a case study from Holiday Extras on our Bulgarian and UK remote teams over the last 18 months.

We'll be sharing the change curve in attitudes and how not only the scrum masters had to get used to remote workers, but the dev team had to get used to remote pair programming.
We'll be delving into the challenges we faced and the changes for the better.
