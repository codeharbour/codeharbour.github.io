Functional programming offers a very different approach to writing code.
Seasoned programmers have reported that learning its techniques has made them feel like beginners.
And yet more and more people are taking the plunge to make it part of their skill set, more employers are demanding it as a skill, and many are saying that learning it has brought joy to their coding lives.

Sam Tracey, a self-taught programmer, shares his experiences of learning Elm over the past year.
He introduces some of the techniques that you can start using in your code straight away, whatever your language, and why, even if you’re a complete beginner, you might consider learning a functional language.

Find out why it’s worth investigating, what your options of languages are, and what are the great teaching resources out there.
