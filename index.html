			<h1>Building in ES6 with jspm and SystemJS</h1>

			<p>In this talk I'll demonstrate how it is possible to architect and write complex client side JavaScript applications in ECMAScript 6 today, despite a lack of implementations across browsers. We'll explore how we can use libraries like SystemJS and Babel to allow us to seamlessly write code in ES6 and consume 3rd party libraries, regardless of the format they are written in. We'll then architect the application as a series of modules using the new ES6 module syntax, and write using new ES6 features like constants, arrow functions, classes and more.</p>

			<p>Using jspm [jspm.io] as our build tool, we'll see how to quickly and easily install libraries from npm and GitHub, and have them work out of the box in the browser. We'll look at the developer workflow and how jspm also makes it trivial to bundle our application up in production. </p>

			<p>Git is a really powerful tool. A lot of that power is deeply hidden, and for good reason: it may only be valuable in certain use cases. You may not run into those use cases very often, but when you do, these lesser-known features might save you literally seconds of time.</p>

						<p>My aim is to take a look at the current state of the web and whether progressive enhancement is still plausible. Looking beyond whether a website works with JavaScript turned off or not. Instead looking at what new tools can offer and especially what game changing software is coming in the near future.</p>
